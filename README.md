## Task

The task at hand was to utilise a weather API to create a webpage that allowed users to search for a 5 day forecast based on the city they search for.
To go in depth, this page would need to consist of a search function, and upon searching for a city, the data would need to be stored in local storage as well as the UI, showing a list of the city's they searched for. This list would need to show in button form, so that the user can revert back to the city they'd previously searched for at a click of a button rather than typing it in again.

I completed the marjority of asks in this porject. Succesfully able to store the users searches in local storage, and have the previous searches displayed in button form. I was able to style the colours so that it looks relatively similar to the example shown. The cards display all of the requested information such as temperature wind and humidity.

Sadly, I was unable to create a function that removes the cards upon each new search and if I had more time, I would delve into why this is happening. I'd love to go back to this project and make improvements in the future.
